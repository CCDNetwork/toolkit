Once we know why we are sharing data, the next step is to work out what data we need to share. This can be complicated because different organisations use different words to describe the same data. One organisation might use the term "last name", while another organisation uses the term "family name"; or different cultures might have different naming conventions which do

The word “standard” can be used in different ways. In the humanitarian sector it is usually used to refer to a minimum set of criteria that an organisation should meet - one example of this is the Sphere Standards. However the word “standard” can also be used to refer to a technical specification of how data should be processed in order to ensure interoperability between different systems - such as these standards.

The CCD developed two such technical specifications - one standard for deduplication and one standard for referrals - for use within the project. They were incorporated into the technical platform as a “translation layer” which enabled participating organisations to upload their data to the platform without needing to reformat it. We are including them in the Toolkit so that other initiatives can adopt or adapt them.

Standards in any sector are always a work in progress - they need to be revised on a regular basis to take account of changing circumstances. The Data Standards presented in the Toolkit should be understood as part of such a process, and not as a final product that cannot be updated or adapted. They should be applied in conjunction with good practice and existing principles around data management.
