While some existing platforms can check for deduplicates and make referrals, CCD’s initial research identified that there were no platforms which could perform these functions on an inter-agency basis.

A decision was taken to develop a proof-of-concept platform which showed that this was possible with twin approaches of “privacy by design” and “data minimisation”.

This proof of concept was developed in response to feedback from pilot partners. Over time it became a fully functional platform which has been security tested and deployed by at least one consortium.

The platform is not a data management platform. It only performs the functions of deduplication and referral, and none of the users - including the host - can see data from outside their organisation.

CCD has made the platform open source so that it could be adapted and used by others. As of the time of writing, CCD had not received funding to continue development, but please contact us if you want an update.
