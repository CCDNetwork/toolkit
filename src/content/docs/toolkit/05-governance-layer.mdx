The Governance layer deals with decision-making about the data which is being shared. Although many humanitarian organisations have internal policies which govern their use of data - including data protection policies - there is a lack of shared governance mechanisms.

As the humanitarian sector becomes increasingly data-driven, it is therefore important to develop new governance mechanisms. At present most data governance is purely hierarchical - a large centralised agency gathers the data from partners and decides what to do with it.

This approach is sometimes appropriate, but often has many weaknesses. The biggest weakness is that it lacks any oversight of the data by the agencies that collect and share that data - and lacks transparency to the communities that provide that data.
