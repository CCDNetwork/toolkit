The Governance layer deals with decision-making about the data which is being shared. Although many humanitarian organisations have internal policies which govern their use of data - including data protection policies - there is a lack of shared governance mechanisms.

As the humanitarian sector becomes increasingly data-driven, it is therefore important to develop new governance mechanisms. At present most data governance is purely hierarchical - a large centralised agency gathers the data from partners and decides what to do with it.

This approach is sometimes appropriate, but often has many weaknesses. The biggest weakness is that it lacks any oversight of the data by the agencies that collect and share that data - and lacks transparency to the communities that provide that data.

In order to help humanitarian coordination groups to address this lack of oversight and transparency, we have developed an alternative collective approach to the existing model. This data stewardship model is embodied in a Governance Framework which we have developed, and which can be adapted as necessary.

## Guidance Note

This Guidance Note and the accompanying Governance Framework for Data Stewardship were drafted by Mugambi Laibuta and Paul Currion, under instruction from Amos Doornbos, for the Collaborative Cash Delivery (CCD) Network. They are part of the CCD Toolkit for Data Governance developed to support CCD interoperability pilot projects between 2022-2024. Version 1.0 of the Framework was considered final on 30th July 2024.

<h2>Background</h2>
The humanitarian sector collects an increasingly large amount of data from and about individuals, households and communities affected by crisis. Humanitarian organisations are often required to share some of that data in order to achieve collective goals.

Data sharing for humanitarian operations ought to operate within decision-making frameworks that can promote privacy, data protection, interoperability, data analytics, data security, community engagement, capacity building, and ethical use of technology.

However there is a lack of tools that can provide humanitarian organisations with a shared approach to their responsibilities regarding data management, leading to some institutional behaviours which are counter-productive.

<h2>Why was the Framework developed?</h2>
Any project which involves data management is not just a technical exercise - it also involves data governance. Data governance addresses critical questions about who is responsible for decision-making about data, including how they set policies and how they establish accountability. This is particularly important when the data sharing involves multiple parties.

Data governance is often overlooked in the humanitarian sector, yet it is increasingly important as more of our work involves data management. If we can develop and maintain appropriate data governance mechanisms, we can ensure that we avoid some of the risks of multi-party data sharing - and remain accountable to our data subjects, the beneficiaries.

The Framework facilitates a collective approach to responsible data management. It is intended to promote principles of data stewardship in the humanitarian sector, and particularly to move towards inclusion of aid recipients into decision-making.

<h2>What does the Framework contain?</h2>
The Governance Framework provides one approach to data governance, which can be adapted and adopted by consortia of humanitarian organisations, to provide them with a solid basis for collective decision-making about data.

The Framework outlines the principles, processes, and administrative structures to be established to facilitate effective and accountable data stewardship initiatives. It consists of the following components:

<h2>How do I apply the Framework?</h2>
You should adapt the Framework to suit the specific environment you are operating in, including the regulatory aspects. You can also adapt the governance relationships and components so that they fit with any existing coordination structures.

The Framework should be accompanied by a Multi Party Data Sharing Agreement, which the CCD have developed a separate template for. Other legal instruments or additional schedules can be added to the Framework as necessary to meet the requirements of the signatories.

The Framework should be implemented in consultation with all the participating organisations. This might include not just senior or programme management staff, but also those involved in IT support, data protection, legal counsel, risk management, and MEAL.

The Framework is a legally binding instrument for the signatories, so you should ensure that there is a consensus between the participating organisations before signing. Other organisations can join the Framework at a later stage if they accept that consensus.
