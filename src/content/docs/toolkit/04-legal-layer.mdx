At this point hopefully everybody knows that you shouldn't share data without a good Data Sharing Agreement (DSA) in place. The DSAs which we use in the humanitarian sector are usually bilateral, though - and if multiple agencies want to share data, this could mean negotiating a series of DSAs. If another party wants to join later, yet another set of DSAs will need to be signed.

To make things simpler, the CCD Network developed a Multi-Party Data Sharing Agreement. We've updated that DSA to reflect the data stewardship approach which we think works best for humanitarian organisations. It is also fully compatible with the separate template for the Governance Framework for Data Stewardship, which you'll find in the Governance Layer section.

The Multi-Party DSA template is ready for use, but you'll want to adapt it for your specific situation. Interoperability projects involve a range of complex issues, including informed consent and data responsibility, which need to be discussed and resolved between the parties involved before they sign. We've included footnotes in the template which can help you to navigate these issues.
