The primary legal instrument in the Toolkit addresses one of the foundational requirements for any interoperability initiative - an updated version of the CCD Multi-Party Data Sharing Agreement (DSA).

The original Multi-Party DSA template was developed by the Collaborative Cash Delivery Network to support their pilot projects to improve data governance within the humanitarian sector.

The template has been updated and adapted to support a specific model of Data Stewardship. It is accompanied by a separate template for a Governance Framework for Data Stewardship.

The template is intended to promote responsible data practices and sharing between organisations in the nonprofit sector. It borrows from corporate best practices and approaches.

However interoperability projects involve a range of complex issues, including informed consent and data responsibility, which need to be discussed and resolved between the parties involved.
