## Research

In 2022 the Collaborative Cash Delivery Network commissioned research into data portability in the humanitarian sector. The research found that a key requirement for data portability is interoperability between systems.

Successfully implementing interoperability mechanisms in the humanitarian sector requires political will, institutional commitments, policy decisions, and technological capabilities that current forms of humanitarian data sharing do not have.

The research also found limited and mixed evidence regarding both the demonstrated benefits to beneficiaries and the possibilities for interoperability across systems. Since interoperability challenges remain, it is important to test new approaches and gather evidence.

In 2023-24 the CCD Network therefore developed pilot projects to address the specific challenges of deduplication and referrals, while improving data governance.

## Design

The first phase of a pilot project is design - more specifically, co-design. This is a process in which different stakeholders work together to answer a series of design questions which can lead to an appropriate solution.

The design questions that we asked to develop the first two pilot projects are described in the document Design Guidance for Data Governance. You can adapt these or think of your own design questions.

We also set out our principles, described in the document 9 Data Governance Design Principles. Clearly articulating your principles at the start of the process will help to ensure that you take a responsible approach.

The design process itself will vary depending on your context. We conducted a series of 3-4 2-hour online workshops with organisations that were interested in addressing their interoperability challenges collectively.

## Implementation

FAQs / Introduction
(include political economy - what is the role of UN, government, private sector, civil society?)

The humanitarian community often relies too much on the technical layer, and almost completely ignores the governance layer. Data governance involves all of the decision-making structures and processes around data management.

A common mistake is to assume that our data protection policies and processes cover this, but data governance mechanisms are required in order to decide what those policies and practices are, who they apply to, and how they are enforced.
