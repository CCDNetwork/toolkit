# What is this all about?

Our work on interoperability and data governance aims to simplify the process for individuals impacted by humanitarian crises to manage their own data and take charge of its management.

We strive to adopt a collaborative approach to overcome practical challenges such as:

*   deduplication of persons and assistance,
    
*   ensuring continuity of services across borders,
    
*   referrals, and
    
*   integration of social protection.
    

â€‹These challenges necessitate the exploration of data governance mechanisms and interoperability of systems. The data of people affected by crises should not be a subject of competition but rather a collective asset managed alongside the affected individuals.

# Acknowledgements

The Toolkit was developed under the guidance of the Collaborative Cash Delivery Network.

Funding through different projects was provided by ECHO, the DEC, ADC, and its member agencies.

Pilots were enabled by the CCD Network in South Sudan and the Ukraine Response Consortium in Ukraine.
