# What is this all about?

Our work on interoperability and data governance aims to simplify the process for individuals impacted by humanitarian crises to manage their own data and take charge of its management.

We strive to adopt a collaborative approach to overcome practical challenges such as:

- deduplication of persons and assistance,

- referrals both within and between sectors,

- ensuring continuity of services across borders, and

- integration with social protection systems.

â€‹These challenges necessitate the exploration of data governance mechanisms and interoperability of systems. The data of people affected by crises should not be a subject of competition but rather a collective asset managed alongside the affected individuals.

# Acknowledgements

The Toolkit was developed under the guidance of the Collaborative Cash Delivery Network, with World Vision International as the project lead. The Toolkit is maintained by the Data Stewardship Collective, an umbrella group for the team of consultants working on the project.

Funding through different projects was provided by ECHO, the DEC, ADC, and its member agencies. The initial phase was implemented in partnership with the IFRC DIGID project, and the pilots were enabled by the CCD Network in South Sudan and the Ukraine Response Consortium in Ukraine.
