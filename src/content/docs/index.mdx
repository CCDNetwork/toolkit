  tagline: As humanitarian organisations, we often need to share data in order to
    help households and communities more efficiently and effectively. We
    developed this Toolkit as a resource to help you and your colleagues to
    share data responsibly in order to address critical challenges, such as
    deduplicating data and making referrals.

# Why do we need this Toolkit?

The humanitarian sector collects more data than in the past, particularly because of the requirements of cash and voucher assistance. Yet while many organisations have policies and platforms for sharing data internally, there are almost no resources available to facilitate sharing data between organisations.

And that's where this Toolkit comes in!

# Who is this Toolkit for?

If you're working in a group of humanitarian organisations which need to share data - whether that's an NGO consortium, a Cash Working Group, or any other body - then you'll find the Toolkit useful. If you're a coordinator, you're going to find the Toolkit _especially_ useful for working with your group.

But how can the Toolkit help you?

# How can I use the Toolkit?

Often data needs to be shared between organisations - perhaps to avoid duplicating assistance, or to refer an individual or household to another organisation which can help them with a specific need. The Toolkit provides a framework and resources to help you to share data responsibly.

# Does the Toolkit help communities?

These tools can help communities indirectly by improving the quality of assistance they receive and ensuring their data is managed responsibly. However the Toolkit explicitly points humanitarian organisations towards a future in which aid recipients enjoy full rights over their own data.

# Acknowledgements

The Toolkit was developed under the guidance of the Collaborative Cash Delivery Network, with World Vision International as the project lead. The Toolkit is maintained by the Data Stewardship Collective, an umbrella group for the team of consultants working on the project.

Funding was provided by ECHO, the DEC, ADC, and its member agencies. The initial phase was implemented in partnership with the IFRC DIGID project, with pilots supported by the CCD Network in South Sudan and the Ukraine Response Consortium in Ukraine.
